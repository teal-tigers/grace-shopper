# Made For Walking: Custom Cowboy Boots

This e-commerce site pairs a backend consisting of node, express and sequelize with a frontend supported by react and redux.

## Features

The navigation bar allows users to view all boots, view details of a single boot product, and view their shopping cart. Users can add boots to their shopping cart from the page displaying their selected boot's details. Users can also delete or update the quantity of their boot selections on their personal shopping cart page.

Users can browse and edit their shopping cart as either guests or when logged into their accounts. In order to create an account, a user must provide their name, email and a password. They may also choose to add a home address, which will be their default shipping address.

A user with a pre-existing account can log in with their email and password.

In order to checkout, a user browsing as a guest must create an account or log in. If the user creates an account, the contents of their guest shopping cart will be transferred to their account. If a user logs in, then their shopping cart page will revert to what was in their shopping cart the last time they were logged in.

## Deployment
